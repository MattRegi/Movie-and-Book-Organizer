# 📚🎬 Movie and Book Organizer

An organizer site that allows you to enter your **books** or **movies** into a list with various parameters, and sort them alphabetically for easy viewing.

This project was made with my wife in mind, and served as a great opportunity to dive into working with **forms**, **JSON**, and handling **user input** by storing it in an array. It also taught me how to **store user data locally in the browser**, so your lists will still be there the next time you visit the site.
